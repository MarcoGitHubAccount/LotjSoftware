# LotjSoftware  
Import the files you wish and read below how to use them  
  
## Jump intercept (jintalias.xml and JintTriggers.xml, DONT GET JintTriggers_specific.xml unless I say to, its a very specific fix not for everyone)  
This calculates and jumps you to the location of where a ship will be  
when you come out of hyperspace. Simply use it like so  
jint shipname  
this will automatically do the work for you, works with all small ships  
and with hammerhead cruisers. If anything goes wrong or you want to cancel  
it simply type  
jint  
that will cancel jint and give you back full control  
  
## Encryptme (encryptme.xml)  
Generates a unique encryption for the channel you input, this  
changes each day. Everyone using the software will get the same output  
if the same channel is input on the same day.  
encryptme 812  
this output 732 on 23/06/2023  
but its that simple, just use it on your desired channel
